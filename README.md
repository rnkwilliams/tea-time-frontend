# TeaTime
TeaTime is a single-page application(SPA) using a Rails API backend with React/Redux frontend. TeaTime is a place where tea drinkers can go to learn about different tea types, keep track of their own teas, and have the option to use a timer for brewing. The backend of the application can be accessed at: https://github.com/rnkwilliams/tea-time-backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Built With üõ†

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Features :star2:

- Integrated Fast JSON API gem to generate serializer classes and customize JSON rendering.
- Developed front-end with React and Redux, creating functional, reactive code with Redux as state manager and
  Rails as backend JSON API.
- Implemented React Router to enable client side rendering and optimized performance
- Designed and styled using Bootstrap to create an optimal browser and mobile experience

## Getting Started :man_astronaut:

1. Fork üç¥ and Star ‚≠êÔ∏è this repository
2. `git clone` to your local directory üíª
3. cd `tea_time_frontend`
4. run `npm install`
5. run `npm start` :tada:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
